-- Hungarian.h 
	- document parameter's meaning
	- is conio.h necessary?
	- should have: core fuunctions and utils function
	- core functions:
			loadInputGraph();// is this implemented in core?? "ADS\Graphs\core" NOT YET! :)
							// this function loads a weighted directed graph (and also bipartite!!!);
							// tricky question: Where should be placed testing whether a digraph graph is bipartite or not?
			Unger ();// takes as input the graph and computes the assignments
			diplayAssignments ();//prints the solution
	- utility functions:
			step1 ... step 6 ... etc...
	
--  Hugarian.cpp
	- Unger(); function does not take any parameter
	- place on top core functions and below utility functions

-- Main.cpp
	- input matrix should be read from an input file
	- the matrix should be given as input to Unger() function
	- Unger() function should return the assignment
	- the assignment must be printed by a function
	
-- How a testing procedure should check optimality of the solution?
